## 👩‍ Overview
Creators face a major problem of managing deals & projects, accepting & managing payments, manage invoices, accept tips from fans, and many more.
we develop a solution for the creator economy which helps to manage their day-to-day task
and makes their life a lot simpler.
    
## 🔆 Tech Stack
The project is created using
-  JavaScript
-  HTML
-  CSS
-  Figma
-  Adobe Illustrator
-  Adobe After Effects

## 👬 Features
i) It provides a to-do list to the creators where he/she add his/her projects and a checklist if they have completed their project the can mark them Marked as done and then it will be remove from their to-do-list.They can also delete their project fromtheir list but before deleting a "Warning Pop-uP " comes to their screen.

  ii) The screen also has a clock which welcomes our user and show date and time and automatically keep updated second to second.
We all want someone to have  our back so it provides you with a feature of ADD A TEAM so that whenever the freelancer is in stress we can decrease his workload by adding a team so that whenever a freelancer is in stress we can decrease is workload by adding a team .   Now to add adding a team he can add any person across the globe and chat with them this provides other person an opportunity to showcase their talents and freelance to decrease his work.
 A lot many times under stress pressure we forget our deadlines so for that we have a feature which will provide reminders to creators whenever a deadline  is approaching now.
 
 Another major problem faced by the creator of freelancer is payment.
Major issues faced in payment such as-
1.	Heavy taxation
2.	Conversion fee while dealing with an international client
3.	Different modes of payment etc.
Our website uses 3 Gateways of Payment –
•	PAYPAL
•	WISE PAYMENT
•	PAYTM
Wise payment has a very low conversion speed that to is to be paid by the client not the creator , sO the salary of freelancer comes directly into account and convert into local currency automatically.
Also, Paypal generate invoices with salt and other challenge of “generating invoices”.
